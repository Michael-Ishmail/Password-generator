Attahced is my completed password generator.

When the "Generate password" button is clicked, the user is prompted with several alert boxes. These alert boxes will ask the user for the desired password length and desired characters. The password will then be generated based on their input.

When the user attempts to input a password character length below 8 or above 128, they will be prompted to try again. 

If the user does not select any characters, they will be prompted to enter at least one character set to generate the password.
